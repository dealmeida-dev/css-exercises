# My Odin Project Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the CSS exercises from The Odin Project (TOP). I've cloned this repository to add my own solutions and track my progress through the curriculum.

## How to Use My Solutions

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine. If you're not familiar with forking, you can refer to the GitHub documentation on [forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
2. Navigate to the specific exercise directory you're interested in, and open the corresponding HTML file in your web browser. You can directly open the file or use tools like VSCode's Live Server extension to view the changes in real time.
3. Read the provided README for each exercise thoroughly before starting any work. Make sure to follow the instructions and understand the self-check criteria.
4. Edit the `index.html` and/or `style.css` files to achieve the desired outcome mentioned in the exercise's README. You might need to make changes in either or both files depending on the exercise requirements.
5. Compare my solutions to your own once you've completed an exercise. Remember not to check my solutions until you've finished implementing your own.
   - Keep in mind that there can be multiple valid solutions. If your solution differs from mine but still meets the self-check criteria, it's perfectly fine.
6. Avoid submitting your solutions directly to this repository, as pull requests for solutions will be closed without merging.

## Some Tips and Hints

- I've followed best practices by adding my CSS changes to existing selectors instead of duplicating them at the end of the file, as seen in the official solutions.
- If the exercise doesn't specify exact pixel values for properties like margin, padding, and font-size, don't worry too much about achieving pixel-perfect accuracy. Focus on understanding the concepts and implementing the layout correctly.
- In some cases, you might need to add additional HTML elements to achieve the desired layout. The READMEs will guide you when this is necessary.
- As the exercises progress, you may need to add more selectors to your CSS file to achieve the correct results.
